Demo of why I wanted when licences are specified in source code files, that they be specified in a certain format.
It can also be extended to reading licences from binary file  properties. etc etc
In short it should save the developer from possibly including source with licences that (s)he may not want for his/her project
Originally thought of over a year ago at the least from 30 March 2022
